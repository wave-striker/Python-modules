import time

for m in range(6): #gAVE THE for loop the m variable and set the range to 6 to get 5 to print. Dont know how to not print the first 0.
    time.sleep(1) #Adds the delay.
    print(m, "mississippi")

print("ready or not here I come!") # the loop ends on the 6th count, then will break to print this.




# Write a for loop that counts to five.
    # Body of the loop - print the loop iteration number and the word "Mississippi".
    # Body of the loop - use: time.sleep(1)

# Write a print function with the final message.
