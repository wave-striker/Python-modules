#Create a user in put to place in the value required for x
x = float(input("Enter value for x: "))
# 1. denotes a float, / x + 1. (another float). working the equation down, creating the variable y to equal the sum of the quation.
y = 1./(x + 1./(x + 1./(x + 1./x)))
#Print the variable y to give you the answer.
